# Open5gs and OAI-GNB 

5G end to end (SA) communication demo using hardware equipment with Open5gs and OpenAirInterface gNB.

This setup uses 2 helm charts generated by Gradiant in OpenVerso: `open5gs` and `oai-gnb`. These charts are packaged and available at Gradiant's OpenVerso helm repo: https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/

Start by adding the helm repo to your Helm CLI:

```
helm repo add openverso https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/
```

# Equipment requirements

The following hardware equipment is required in order to replicate the setup used for this tutorial:

- **USRP Software Defined Radio Device**, which is supported by the **UHD** (*USRP Hardware Driver*) **Software**. In our setup, an **Ettus USRP B210** was used.
- **UE** (*User Equipment*) suitable for connecting to this network deployment. In our setup, a **tablet** (Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G) was used.
- **Sysmocom USIM** with known credentials inserted into the UE. The one used in our setup was a **sysmoISIM-SJA2**.

It is recommended to keep the UE with the **airplane mode turned on** until the NGC and RAN have been successfully deployed and connected.

# Deployment NGC and registration of subscriber

First, deploy the NGC (open5gs) using the `5gSA-values.yaml` file provided in order to overwrite some of the default values of the **Open5GS chart**:

```
helm install open5gs openverso/open5gs --version 1.2.3 --values https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/docs/open5gs-oaignb/5gSA-values.yaml 
```

These new values will:

- Disable the Open5gs EPC, deploying only the functions of the Open5gs 5G SA Core.
- Set the MCC, MNC, TAC to be used by the AMF, as well as the SST and SD for the slice, which are also used by the NSSF. Notice that these values match the ones mentioned later for the subscriber's registration, being also tied together with the **sysmocom USIM's** credentials.
- Disable the Ingress for accessing the Open5GS WebUI.
- Enable the *populate* option, which will create a Deployment using the `openverso/open5gs-dbctl` image. This will provide an easy way to manage the subscribers. In addition, the *initCommands* specified will manage the registration of the corresponding subscriber. As you can see, the subscriber is registered by providing the *imsi, key, opc, apn, sst* and *sd*, thus configuring already its corresponding **slice**. Take into account that the values provided are tied together with the **sysmocom USIM's** credentials in the UE.

The successful registration can be verified following 2 different approaches:

- **Directly through MongoDB**

```
kubectl exec deployment/open5gs-mongodb -ti -- bash

mongo

use open5gs

db.subscribers.find().pretty()
```
- **Using the Open5GS WebUI**: forward a local port to a port on the corresponding Pod by specifying the WebUI Service. Then, the Open5GS WebUI will be available at `localhost:3000`. To do this, execute:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/open5gs-webui 3000:3000
```

# Deployment RAN

Before installing the corresponding helm chart, make sure of having properly **connected your USRP** to one of your cluster's nodes.

Now, deploy the RAN (oai-gnb) using the *gnb-values.yaml* file provided in order to overwrite some of the default values of the **oai-gnb chart**:

```
helm install oai-gnb openverso/oai-gnb --version 0.3.1 --values https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/docs/open5gs-oaignb/gnb-values.yaml 
```

Thus, this deployment will launch the **eNodeB** and connect it to the Open5GS NGC.

It is important to notice that the default values in th **gnb** section for **mcc, mnc, mncLength, tac, sst and sd0** match those configured in the **open5gs** chart and the registered UE.

In addition, take into account that the value given for ***gnb.amf*** must match the name of the corresponding AMF service deployed by the open5gs chart. Therefore, in case you use a differente release name for the open5gs chart, make sure that this value is set accordingly.

The value for ***image.tag*** provided is set to `2022.w20`, since it was the version of the `openverso/oai` image tested in this tutorial.

# Verify EPC and RAN connectivity

## Connection between SMF and UPF (C-Plane and U-Plane of NGC)

Check that the SMF gets associated with the UPF's address:
```
kubectl logs deployment/open5gs-smf -f
```

## Connection between AMF and gNodeB

Check that the AMF accepts and adds the gNodeB:
```
kubectl logs deployment/open5gs-amf -f
```
![AMF finds gNodeB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts/gh-pages/docs/open5gs-oaignb/screenshots/amf_gnb.png "AMF and gNodeB connected")

Check that gNodeB is deployed successfully and that is waiting for UE's detection:
```
kubectl logs oai-gnb-0 -f
```
![gNodeB waiting for UE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts/gh-pages/docs/open5gs-oaignb/screenshots/gnb_launched.png "gNodeB waiting for UE")

# Connect UE to the network

Once the NGC and RAN are deployed and successfully connected as shown above, the UE will be able to connect to the network. Make sure that it has de sysmocom USIM with the registered credentials correctly inserted.

Also, check the **APN configuration** in the UE. It has to be enabled the following APN:
- APN name: *internet*
- APN: *internet*
- APN type: *default*
- MCC and MNC matching those previously set for the AMF and NSSF

At this point, you can turn off the **airplane mode** in the UE so it starts attempting to connect to the network.

## Verify UE's connectivity

Check that the UE got successfully attached to the network:
 ```
kubectl logs deployment/open5gs-amf -f
```
![UE attached to network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts/gh-pages/docs/open5gs-oaignb/screenshots/ue_attached.png "UE attached to network")

We installed and used the **PingTools** application in the UE in order to test the UE's connectivity. Open this application and, through the ***ping*** section of the app, you can easily test the UE's connectivity to the gNodeB and to the Internet:

![UE's connectivity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts/gh-pages/docs/open5gs-oaignb/screenshots/ping_tablet.jpg "UE's connectivity")

Check that the gNodeB is seeing data from the UE:

![UE's connectivity to gNB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts/gh-pages/docs/open5gs-oaignb/screenshots/ue_gnb.png "UE's connectivity to gNB")

It's even possible to check that the UEs' traffic is being routed correctly through their PDU sessions, capturing the packets in the UPF. The installation of **tcpdump** in the corresponding pod is needed in order to complete this check:
```
kubectl exec open5gs-upf-0 -ti -- bash

apt update && apt install tcpdump

tcpdump -i ogstun
```

# Clean
Clean the deployment for this demo by uninstalling the 2 helm charts previously installed:
```
helm uninstall oai-gnb

helm uninstall open5gs
```
