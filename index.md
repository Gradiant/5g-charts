# Helm Charts Collection of Openverso Project

This repo mantains helm charts generated by **Gradiant** in **OpenVerso**.

The main objective of OpenVerso, the National Network of Excellence in 5G and future technologies, is to address the design of an architecture of a comprehensive 5G network, evolvable to 6G technologies, and aimed at creating a federated ecosystem that enables knowledge transfer to the industrial sector.

Follow the README.md of each chart to evaluate the technologies in your kubernetes cluster.

Also, here you can check out our **available tutorials** to deploy different setups that combine these technologies.

## Install chart from helm repository

Charts in `charts/` folder of the GitHub repo are packaged and available at Gradiant's openverso helm repo:  

[https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/](https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/)

You can add the helm repo to your Helm CLI:

```bash
helm repo add openverso https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/
```

Then you have a collection of charts available to install. For example, to install open5gs:

```bash
helm install open5gs openverso/open5gs
```

## Install chart from release

Install using the URL of the release. For example, to install open5gs v0.1.0 chart:

```bash
helm install https://github.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts/releases/download/open5gs-0.1.0/open5gs-0.1.0.tgz
```

## Development

- clone repo https://github.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts.git
- adjust given chart
- bump chart version if required
- run tests
- create pull request with issue id, attach test results if possible

### Requirements

- linting requires docker
- running test-install.sh requires docker and kubernetes-in-docker.
- `tee` console tool to output to the console and file in the same time

## Linting and testing full deployment

We use helm [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) running a docker image.

An example to test specific chart lint and install, send console logs also to the log file `reports/*.log`:

```bash
scripts/lint-install.sh open5gs | tee reports/open5gs.log
```
