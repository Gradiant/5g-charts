# Helm Charts Collection of Openverso Project

This repo mantains helm charts generated by Gradiant in OpenVerso.

The main objective of OpenVerso, the National Network of Excellence in 5G and future technologies, is to address the design of an architecture of a comprehensive 5G network, evolvable to 6G technologies, and aimed at creating a federated ecosystem that enables knowledge transfer to the industrial sector.

Follow the README.md of each chart to evaluate the technologies in your kubernetes cluster.

## Install chart from helm repository

charts in `charts/`` folder are packaged and available at Gradiant's openverso helm repo:  

[https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/](https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/)

You can add the helm repo to your Helm CLI:

```bash
helm repo add openverso https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/
```

Then you have a collection of charts available to install. For example, to install open5gs:

```bash
helm install gradiant/open5gs
```

## Install chart from release

install using the URL of the release. For example, to install open5gs v0.1.0 chart:

```bash
helm install https://github.com/Gradiant/openverso-charts/releases/download/open5gs-0.1.0/open5gs-0.1.0.tgz
```

## Check out our tutorials

We have developed some tutorials meant to **guide you through the combined deployment of different technologies**. It is an easy and quick way of testing these technologies and exploring how they work.

These tutorials make use of charts available at this helm repo, and their corresponding documentation can be found at:
[https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/](https://gradiant.github.io/openverso-charts/)

## Development

- clone repo
- adjust given chart
- bump chart version if required
- run tests
- create pull request with issue id, attach test results if possible

### Requirements

- linting requires docker
- running test-install.sh requires docker and kubernetes-in-docker.
- `tee` console tool to output to the console and file in the same time

## Linting and testing full deployment

We use helm [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) running a docker image.

An example to test specific chart lint and install, send console logs also to the log file `reports/*.log`:

```bash
scripts/lint-install.sh open5gs | tee reports/open5gs.log
```
