# Gradiant 5G Charts

This repo mantains helm charts generated by [Gradiant](https://www.gradiant.org) for its Lab5G platform.

Gradiant is actively researching and developing Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) with special focus on 5G network and evolvable to 6G technologies.

Follow the README.md of each chart to evaluate the technologies in your kubernetes cluster.

## Install chart from DockerHub repository

charts in `charts/`` folder are packaged and available at Gradiant's DockerHub repo:  

[https://hub.docker.com/u/gradiant](https://hub.docker.com/u/gradiant)

You can pull and save locally the chart. For example:

```bash
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/gradiant/open5gs --version 2.2.0
```

You can directly install the chart. For example, to install open5gs:

```bash
helm install open5gs oci://registry-1.docker.io/gradiant/open5gs --version 2.2.0
```

## Check out our tutorials

We have developed some tutorials meant to **guide you through the combined deployment of different technologies**. It is an easy and quick way of testing these technologies and exploring how they work.

These tutorials make use of charts available at this repo, and their corresponding documentation can be found at:
[https://gradiant.github.io/5g-charts/](https://gradiant.github.io/5g-charts/)

## Development

- clone repo
- adjust given chart
- bump chart version if required
- run tests
- create pull request with issue id, attach test results if possible

### Requirements

- linting requires docker
- running test-install.sh requires docker and kubernetes-in-docker.
- `tee` console tool to output to the console and file in the same time

## Linting and testing full deployment

We use helm [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) running a docker image.

An example to test specific chart lint and install, send console logs also to the log file `reports/*.log`:

```bash
scripts/lint-install.sh open5gs | tee reports/open5gs.log
```
