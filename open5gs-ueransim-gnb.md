# Open5gs and UERANSIM 

5G end to end (SA) communication demo with Open5gs and UERANSIM.

This setup uses 2 helm charts generated by Gradiant: `open5gs` and `ueransim-gnb`. These charts are packaged and available at Gradiant's DockerHub repo: https://hub.docker.com/u/gradiant

If you want to have the repo in local you can pull it:
```
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/gradiant/open5gs --version 2.2.0
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/gradiant/ueransim-gnb --version 0.2.6
```

# Deployment NGC and registration of subscribers

First, deploy the NGC (open5gs) using the `5gSA-values.yaml` file provided in order to overwrite some of the default values of the **Open5GS chart**:

```
helm install open5gs oci://registry-1.docker.io/gradiant/open5gs --version 2.2.0 --values https://gradiant.github.io/5g-charts/docs/open5gs-ueransim-gnb/5gSA-values.yaml 
```

These new values will:

- Disable the Open5gs EPC, deploying only the functions of the Open5GS 5G SA Core.
- Enable the *populate* option, which will create a Deployment using the `gradiant/open5gs-dbctl` image. This will provide an easy way to manage the subscribers. In addition, the *initCommands* specified will register two subscribers initially, with the *imsi, key, opc, apn, sst* and *sd* provided.
- Disable the Ingress for accessing the Open5GS WebUI.  


# Deployment RAN

Now, deploy the RAN (ueransim-gnb) using the *gnb-ues-values.yaml* file provided in order to overwrite some of the default values of the **ueransim-gnb chart**:

```
helm install ueransim-gnb oci://registry-1.docker.io/gradiant/ueransim-gnb --version 0.2.6 --values https://gradiant.github.io/5g-charts/docs/open5gs-ueransim-gnb/gnb-ues-values.yaml 
```

Thus, this deployment will not only launch the **gNodeB**, but it will also enable the launching of **2 UEs**. They will use consecutive MSIDNs, starting from the value of ***ues.initialMSISDN*** (0000000001, by default).

It is important to notice that the default values of **mcc, mnc, sst, sd and tac** match those configured in the **open5gs** chart and the registered UEs.

In addition, take into account that the value given for ***amf.hostname*** must match the name of the correponding AMF service deployed by the open5gs chart. Therefore, in case you use a differente release name for the open5gs chart, make sure that this value is set accordingly. 


# Verify deployment

## Connection between SMF and UPF (C-Plane and U-Plane of NGC)

Check that the SMF gets associated with the UPF's address:
```
kubectl logs deployment/open5gs-smf -f
```

## Connection between AMF and gNodeB

Check that the AMF accepts and adds the gNodeB:
```
kubectl logs deployment/open5gs-amf -f
```

Check that gNodeB establishes SCTP connection successfully and that the NG Setup procedure was successful as well:
```
kubectl logs deployment/ueransim-gnb -f
```

## UE's connectivity
Check that both UEs established their PDU Session successfully, creating each of them one tunnel interface (`uesimtun0` and `uesimtun1`):
```
kubectl exec deployment/ueransim-gnb-ues -ti -- bash

ip addr
```

![UEs tunnel interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gradiant/5g-charts/gh-pages/docs/open5gs-ueransim-gnb/screenshots/ues_tunnels.png "UEs tunnel interfaces")

Check that UEs have connectivity through these interfaces:
```
ping gradiant.org -I uesimtun0

ping gradiant.org -I uesimtun1
```
![UEs connectivity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gradiant/5g-charts/gh-pages/docs/open5gs-ueransim-gnb/screenshots/ues_ping.png "UEs connectivity")

It's even possible to check that the UEs' traffic is being routed correctly through their PDU sessions, capturing the packets in the UPF. The installation of **tcpdump** in the corresponding pod is needed in order to complete this check:
```
kubectl exec deployment/open5gs-upf -ti -- bash

apt update && apt install tcpdump

tcpdump -i ogstun
```

# Add additional subscribers using *open5gs-populate*

Once the NGC is deployed, we can register additional subscribers at any time by using the Deployment previously described:
```
kubectl exec deployment/open5gs-populate -ti -- bash
```

From there, we can register a new subscriber by executing the following command, providing the corresponding values for *imsi, key, opc, apn, sst* and *sd*:
```
open5gs-dbctl add_ue_with_slice <imsi> <key> <opc> <apn> <sst> <sd>
```

After that, the changes can be verified following 2 different approaches:

- **Directly through MongoDB**

```
kubectl exec deployment/open5gs-mongodb -ti -- bash

mongo

use open5gs

db.subscribers.find().pretty()
```
- **Using the Open5GS WebUI**: forward a local port to a port on the corresponding Pod by specifying the WebUI Service. Then, the Open5GS WebUI will be available at `localhost:9999`. To do this, execute:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/open5gs-webui 9999:9999
```

# Clean
Clean the deployment for this demo by uninstalling the 2 helm charts previously installed:
```
helm uninstall ueransim-gnb

helm uninstall open5gs
```
